# CONFIDE Version 2.0
Confide, Anonymously.

Your frustrations, joys, and pains.

Have you ever wanted to post something on Facebook or Twitter, but didn't want the world to see it? Or maybe you have a secret you need to get off your chest, but are scared of what people might think? 

With Confide, you can share your deepest secrets with the world, or express your pains, joys, and frustrations completely anonymously. It's a place where you can share your innermost thoughts, in a constructive way.

There is only one rule of etiquette: The Golden Rule.
